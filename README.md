# Enhancing Efficiency through Barcode/QR Code

## About

The proposed project aims to develop an advanced barcode and QR code scanning system leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques for real-time detection and decoding. Unlike traditional scanners that rely on laser technology for 1D barcodes or standalone mobile apps limited to basic image processing, this system is designed to handle dynamic environments, complex lighting, and varied angles. It integrates object detection algorithms to locate and isolate codes within busy or complex video feeds, enhancing accuracy and speed. Additionally, the system will connect with cloud services to facilitate seamless data handling, enabling features like automated searches or direct links to e-commerce sites. With improved adaptability, security, and flexibility, this project targets applications across retail, logistics, and other sectors requiring robust, responsive scanning solutions.

## Features

1. Real-Time Detection and Decoding: Uses machine learning to decode barcodes and QR codes instantly, even in live video feeds.

2. Advanced Object Detection: Employs object detection algorithms to accurately locate codes in complex scenes, enhancing recognition speed and accuracy.

3. Adaptability to Diverse Conditions: Capable of handling variations in lighting, angles, and partially obscured codes for reliable scanning across environments.

4. Cloud Integration: Links with cloud services to enable post-scan data handling, automated searches
